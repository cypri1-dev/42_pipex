## Description
The `pipex` program takes four arguments:
- `infile`: the input file to be read and piped into the first command.
- `cmd1`: the first command to be executed.
- `cmd2`: the second command to be executed.
- `outfile`: the output file where the result of the pipeline will be written.

The program executes the command pipeline `cmd1 | cmd2` and redirects the input and output accordingly, similar to the behavior of the shell command `|` (pipe).
